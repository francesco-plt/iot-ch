# COAP

## Question 1

 What are the differences between the request with MID:  53533 and the one with MID: 42804?

### Answer

by filtering the given capture with Wireshark we can see the details of the request packets with MID 53533 and MID 42804:

* **Packet 6294**

  It's a COAP request packet, which is marked as confirmable and it's using a GET method:

  | MID              | 53533            |
  | ---------------- | ---------------- |
  | Source IP        | `10.0.2.15`      |
  | Destination IP   | `134.102.218.18` |
  | Source Port      | `50593`          |
  | Destination Port | `5683`           |
  | Protocol         | COAP             |
  | Method           | `GET`            |
  | Type             | Confirmable      |
  | Token            | `242f92f0`       |
  | Endpoint         | `/large`         |
  
* **Packet 6276**

  It's also a COAP request packet, but it's using a delete method and it's non-confirmable:

  | MID              | 42804            |
  | ---------------- | ---------------- |
  | Source IP        | `10.0.2.15`      |
  | Destination IP   | `104.196.15.150` |
  | Source Port      | `58700`          |
  | Destination Port | `5683`           |
  | Protocol         | COAP             |
  | Method           | `DELETE`         |
  | Type             | Non-confirmable  |
  | Token            | `6dbdd020`       |
  | Endpoint         | `/link2`         |

The main difference between the two lies in the used method and in the fact that the first packet is confirmable while the second one is not, which means that the first packet has a much higher reliability since it requires an ACK response from the target destination.

## Question 2

What is the response of message No. 2428, if any?

### Answer

First we need to filter out packet with frame number 2428 in Wireshark with the following filter:

````shell
frame.number == 2428
````

By doing that we can find a COAP request with the following characteristics: `Constrained Application Protocol, Non-Confirmable, DELETE, MID:12935`. Since its marked as non-confirmable, an ACK from the target machine is not requested.

I found a matching response by looking for a packet with the same token, which is `67c7229a`. The following result came up: `Constrained Application Protocol, Non-Confirmable, 2.02 Deleted, MID:844`

| MID              | 844                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Source IP        | `localhost`         |
| Destination IP   | `localhost`         |
| Source Port      | `5683`              |
| Destination Port | `37584`             |
| Protocol         | COAP                |
| Response         | `2.02 Deleted`      |
| Type             | Non-confirmable     |
| Token            | `67c7229a`          |
| Endpoint         | `/living_room/door` |

## Question 3

How many replies to requests of type confirmable, having result code `Content` are received by the client  `localhost`?

### Answer

By applying the following filter:

```
((((ip.dst == 127.0.0.1)) && (coap))) && (coap.code == 69)
```

Which is filtering the capture by setting `localhost`as destination address, COAP as protocol and `2.05 Content` as type, we get the following result:

```
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:63229, 2.05 Content, /living_room
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:4920, 2.05 Content,  /living_room
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:23246, 2.05 Content, /living_room
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:13240, 2.05 Content, /living_room
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:29961, 2.05 Content, /living_room
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:25273, 2.05 Content, /living_room
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:48882, 2.05 Content, /living_room
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	CoAP	69	ACK, MID:21099, 2.05 Content, /living_room
```

Which means that there are 8 packets in total which respect the given constraints.

## Question 4

How many GET requests, excluding `OBSERVE`  requests, have been directed to non existing resources?

### Answer

Assuming that with non existing resources we are referring to responses which have a `4.04 Not Found (132) ` response code, we need to find how many non `OBSERVE` requests have been sent to match such responses. I have built the following script after exporting the capture as  `.json` in Wireshark:

```python
from json import loads


def pkt_parser(pkt, path):
    if path == "":
        return pkt["_source"]["layers"]
    out = pkt["_source"]["layers"]
    for el in path.split("/"):
        out = out[el]
    return out


def find_key(pkt, path):
    try:
        pkt_parser(pkt, path)
        return True
    except KeyError:
        return False


def q4(cap):
    res = []
    for pkt in cap:
        if (
            "coap" in pkt_parser(pkt, "frame/frame.protocols")
            and pkt_parser(pkt, "coap/coap.code") == "132"
        ):
            res.append(pkt)
    print("found {} [404] response packets".format(len(res)))

    reqs = []
    for r in res:
        token = pkt_parser(r, "coap/coap.token")
        for pkt in cap:
            if (
                "coap" in pkt_parser(pkt, "frame/frame.protocols")
                and pkt_parser(pkt, "coap/coap.token") == token
                and pkt_parser(pkt, "coap/coap.code") == "1"
            ):
                if find_key(pkt, "coap/opt.observe"):
                    if pkt_parser(pkt, "coap/opt.observe") == "0":
                        reqs.append(pkt)
                else:
                    reqs.append(pkt)
    print("found {} matching responses".format(len(reqs)))


def main():
    cap = loads(open("cap.json").read())
    q4(cap)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

By running the script we get the following result:

```shell
$ p app.py
found 8 [404] response packets
found 6 matching responses
```

6 matches were found.

# MQTT

## Question 5

How many messages containing the topic  `factory/department*/+` are published by a client with user password: `admin`?  Where `*` replaces only the dep. number `[0-9]`, e.g. `factory/department1/+`, `factory/department2/+` and so on?

### Answer

We can easily modify the previous script by replacing `q4` with `q5` which does the computation we need:

```python
def q5(cap):
    src = []
    res = []

    for pkt in cap:
        if find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.passwd"):
            if pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.passwd") == "admin":
                src.append(
                    [pkt_parser(pkt, "ip/ip.src"), pkt_parser(pkt, "tcp/tcp.srcport")]
                )

    for pkt in cap:
        for s in src:
            if find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.topic") and find_key(
                pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.msgtype"
            ):
                if (
                    "factory/department" in pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.topic")
                    and pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.msgtype") == "3"
                    and pkt_parser(pkt, "ip/ip.src") in s[0]
                    and pkt_parser(pkt, "tcp/tcp.srcport") in s[1]
                ):
                    if (
                        pkt_parser(pkt, "ip/ip.src") in s[0]
                        and pkt_parser(pkt, "tcp/tcp.srcport") in s[1]
                    ):
                        res.append(pkt)

    print("found {} matching packets".format(len(res)))
```

In the first loop we filter all the packets which have MQTT password set to `admin`, by annotating their source IP and port. Then for each packet in the capture we check if there's a MQTT message of type `PUBLISH` which contain the substring `factory/department` in the topic field. Then we match those results with each ip-port tuple. The condition on the topic is less restrictive than the requested one, but in this case I left the code as it is because the query returns zero packets as result, which means that restricting the scope of the query would not change the final outcome. When ran the script gives the following output:

```sh
$ p app.py 
found 13 matching packets
```

There are 13 matching packets in total with the desired constraints.

**Note**: I interpreted "containing" as the fact that the given substring should be present in the topic field of relevant packets. Another possible assumption could also be that the plus symbol is intended as a single level wilcard. In this case there should be zero matching packets. I choose the first option since single level wildcards are only relevant in subscribing messages, but we are looking for publish messages.

## Question 6

How many clients connected to the public broker  "mosquitto" have specified a will message?

### Answer

First we look for the DNS queries in Wireshark by using the following filter:

```
dns.qry.name == "test.mosquitto.org"
```

Which gives us a series of packets whose responses all return the same answer: `test.mosquitto.org: type A, class IN, addr 5.196.95.208`. Now by filtering out packets that have that IP set as destination and that have the will flag set:

```
(ip.dst == 5.196.95.208) && (mqtt.conflag.willflag == 1)
```

We get 9 hits:

```
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	133	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	125	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	149	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	149	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	157	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	157	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	145	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	133	Connect Command
10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	133	Connect Command
```

## Question 7

How many publishes with QoS 2 donâ€™t receive the `PUBREL`?

### Answer

To answer this question we need a slight modification of the usual script which does the following operations:

1. Looks for publishes with QoS 2
2. annotes their `msgid`
3. For each of them, checks for `PUBREL` messages with the same id

```python
def q7(cap):
    res = []
    for pkt in cap:
        if find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.qos") and find_key(
            pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.msgtype"
        ):
            if (
                pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.qos") == "2"
                and pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.msgtype") == "3"
            ):
                res.append(pkt)
    print("found {} packets with QoS=2, ".format(len(res)), end="")

    for pkt in res:
        msgid = pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.msgid")
        for pkt in cap:
            if find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.msgid") and find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.mgstype"):
                if (
                    pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.msgid") == msgid
                    and pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.mgstype") == "6"
                ):
                    res.remove(pkt)
    print("of which {} have no PUBREL response".format(len(res)))
```

```
$ p app.py
found 92 packets with QoS=2, of which 92 have no PUBREL response
```

This is because there are no `PUBREL`  at all in the capture.

## Question 8

What is the average Will Topic Length specified by clients with empty Client ID?

### Answer

This function loops trough the capture, selects only packets with empty `clientId` and computes the average of their `willTopic` length.

```python
def q8(cap):
    sum = 0
    count = 0
    for pkt in cap:
        if not find_key(pkt, "_ws.malformed") and find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.clientid"):
            if pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.clientid") == "":
                if find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.willtopic_len"):
                    sum += int(pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.willtopic_len"))
                    count += 1
    print(
        "found {} packets. average will topic length: {}".format(count, (sum / count))
    )
```

```
$ p app.py
found 37 packets. average will topic length: 37.054054054054056	
```

## Question 9

How many ACKs received the client with ID  `6M5H8y3HJD5h4EEscWknTD`? What type(s) is(are) it(them)?

### Answer

First of all we need to find the address of such client. We can do that by applying the following filter in Wireshark:

```
(mqtt.clientid == "6M5H8y3HJD5h4EEscWknTD")
```

As a result we get the packet that the client we are looking for used to establish a connection with the MQTT broker:

```
4659	109.331682932	10.0.2.15	5.196.95.208	MQTT	157	Connect Command
```

So we know that our client has address `10.0.2.15` and is using port `46295`. Now we can filter packets that are using the MQTT protocol and that have the same IP and port as the source of the packet containing our client id:

```
mqtt && ip.dst == 10.0.2.15 && tcp.dstport == 46295
```

We get a lot of results. We need to filter out only ACK packets. We can have the following types of ACK messages:

* Connect ACK `(2)`
* Subscribe ACK `(9)`
* Publish ACK `(4)`

```
mqtt && (ip.dst == 10.0.2.15 && tcp.dstport == 46295)
&& (mqtt.msgtype == 4 || mqtt.msgtype == 2 || mqtt.msgtype == 9)
```

Returning three packets, some of which contain more than one ACK in the same packet. By looking at them in Wireshark we can see that there are 5 ACKs in total, divided in the following way:

| ACK type      | #    |
| ------------- | ---- |
| Connect ACK   | 1    |
| Subscribe ACK | 3    |
| Publish ACK   | 1    |

## Question 10

What is the average MQTT message length of the `CONNECT` messages using MQTT v3.1 protocol? Why  messages have different size?

### Answer

We can filter out packets with MQTT version 3 and message of type `CONNECT`, and then compute the average of their message length:

```python
def q10(cap):
    sum = 0
    count = 0
    for pkt in cap:
        if (
            find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.ver")
            and find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.msgtype")
            and find_key(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.len")
        ):
            if (
                pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.ver") == "3"
                and pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.hdrflags_tree/mqtt.msgtype") == "1"
            ):
                sum += int(pkt_parser(pkt, "mqtt/mqtt.len"))
                count += 1
    print("average message length: {}".format(sum / count))
```

```shell
$ p app.py
average message length: 63.59574468085106
```

This discrepancy is due to the fact that MQTT packets may have lots of different optional fields, which all contribute to determine a noticeable difference in message length.
